<p>ReadMyTables provides a common Java interface for accessing tabular data across different data sources eg: delimited files, Excel files etc. </p>
<p>A table consists of a header and multiple rows, with each column consisting of values of the same Java type.  </p>
<p>Through the use of CellReaders, ReadMyTables will produce typed Java objects (String, Character, Boolean, Integer, Long etc.) from untyped tabular data. </p>
<p>Includes: 
<ul>
<li>utils for narrowing objects, ie: converting them to the smallest possible type without losing fidelity </li>
<li>support for handling missing cell values </li>
</ul>
<p>See also ReadMyTablesFromFiles which provides implementations for reading tables from delimited (eg: CSV) text files and Excel (XLS/XLSX) files. </li>
